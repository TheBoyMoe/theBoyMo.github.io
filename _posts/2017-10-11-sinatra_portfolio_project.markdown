For my project I created a Goodreads.com clone called Simplereads. It allows you to search the Goodreads database for books that you are reading, want to read or have read and add them to a book shelf. You can add reviews and view the reviews of other users - but can only edit your own.

It implements the following:
* Sinatra web framework
* ActiveRecord - associations & migrations(creating multiple tables, models and relationships) and query interface
* MCV design pattern
* OOP design in Ruby
* Sessions and Cookies
* Restful routes, CRUD & 7 basic REST actions
* Controllers in Sinatra
* Password authentication using the Bcrypt ruby gem.
* Rack Flash messages to display information to the user
* Validate user input
* RSpec, Capybara & TDD

You can view the git repo here:
