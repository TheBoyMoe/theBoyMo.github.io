There are a number of reasons I chose software development. The challenge and the opportunity to push one's self. The opportunity to make a contribution , such as sharing your code and contributing to open source software. The opportunity to be constantly learning, and I love to learn. But above all is the opportunity to express the creativity I never realized I had. 

I've spent the last 20 years working in different fields where I was never really challenged. My employers constantly set limits on what I could do. There are no limits now. You can go as far as your desire will take you. The next few decades are going to bring massive chnage. I'm going to play a part in that. What that is I don't know. But I know I'm going to code it!

Time to get back, I've got a lot of time to make up for.
