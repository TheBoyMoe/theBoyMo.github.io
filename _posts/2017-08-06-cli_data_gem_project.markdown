I've just published version 0.3.0 to rubygems.org to complete my take on the CLI Data Gem project. The gem is called meetup-scraper, and as the name implies it allows  you to scrape Meetup.com for events near you.

To install the gem, enter 'gem install meetup-scraper' from the command prompt. Once oinstalled the app can be launched by entering 'meetup-scraper' and then following the prompts. The video walkthrough shows the app in action.  You can check out the code at [github](https://github.com/theBoyMo/ruby-web-scraping-cli-app)

You can see the video walkthrough on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/QCi7bAy_PIg)
