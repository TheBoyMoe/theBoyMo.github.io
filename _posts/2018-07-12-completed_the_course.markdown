I did it.  Twelve months, a huge amount of work. Countless labs. A Ruby, Sinatra and React/Rails Project later and I have finally reached the end.

It's been a long tweleve months. I've been looking forward to this for so long that it actually feels like an anti-climax now. I didn't plan on it taking more than 8 months, but some how - it all took so much longer than I thought. Although mostly ups, there have been some real frustrating moments. But it never crossed my mind to stop. I was going to finish, and finish I did.

I going to take some time off and start looking for work. And when I'm not doing that I'm going to do what I love, code!
